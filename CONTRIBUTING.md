# Contributing to QPFolio

Thank you for your interest in **QPFolio**!  
This project is currently in its **initial development phase (v0.1.x)** and is not yet open for outside contributions.

---

## Current Status
QPFolio is under active internal development while its mathematical formulations, architecture, and testing framework are being stabilized.  
Because the early design and solver interface are still evolving, contributions are temporarily limited to maintain consistency and reproducibility.

If you are interested in following progress:
- You can ⭐ the repository to watch for updates.
- You can review `ROADMAP.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` to track planned features and version milestones.
- Once the core API stabilizes, contribution guidelines will be expanded to include code style, testing, and pull request procedures.

---

## Future Contribution Policy
When the project opens for contributions, it will likely follow these principles:
1. **Code style:** PEP 8 with type hints (`mypy` compatible).
2. **Testing:** All new code must include pytest-based tests and maintain ≥90% coverage.
3. **Documentation:** Public functions must have docstrings and mathematical context.
4. **Branching model:** Feature branches with descriptive names; pull requests reviewed before merging.
5. **Commit messages:** Clear, imperative tone with concise summaries.

---

## Communication
Please do not submit unsolicited pull requests or patches at this time.  
Bug reports, questions, or suggestions may be submitted as GitHub Issues — these will help inform the design of the public contribution process once the API stabilizes.

---

## Licensing
All contributions (when accepted) will fall under the project’s existing open-source license, as specified in the `LICENSE` file.

**In short:**  
> QPFolio is still finding its mathematical and structural footing.  
> Contributions will be warmly welcomed once the foundation is stable.

Thank you for your understanding and patience during early development.
