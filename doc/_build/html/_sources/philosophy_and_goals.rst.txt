Philosophy and Goals
====================

The **QPFolio** project is guided by a clear, minimalist philosophy:
combine *mathematical rigor* with *software simplicity* to make quadratic
portfolio optimization both transparent and extensible.

QPFolio’s design principles and goals are outlined below.

----

Core Philosophy
---------------

**1. Mathematical Clarity**
   Every optimization model implemented in QPFolio is expressed in a canonical,
   reproducible form. Equations, constraints, and assumptions are documented
   explicitly to ensure that users can trace code to theory without ambiguity.

**2. Reliability and Reproducibility**
   Optimization results should be numerically stable and easily replicated.
   Deterministic behavior, fixed random seeds, and clearly defined solvers are
   used wherever possible.

**3. Transparency Over Complexity**
   Simplicity is preferred over hidden abstractions.  
   Every model, constraint, and solver interface can be inspected and modified
   directly without relying on opaque black-box layers.

**4. Modularity and Extensibility**
   The library is built around a modular structure:
   - Core definitions of problems and solutions (`ProblemSpec`, `Solution`)
   - Solver interfaces (e.g., OR-Tools, OSQP, CVXPY)
   - Independent modules for data, metrics, and visualization

   This design enables easy experimentation with new risk measures,
   constraints, or alternative solvers.

**5. Explainable Optimization**
   Every output from QPFolio — weights, risks, metrics — must be interpretable.
   The system is designed to “explain its math,” making it suitable for research,
   audit, and regulatory environments.

Project Goals
--------------

**Short-Term Goals (v0.1–v0.2)**

* Establish a stable API for convex QP formulations:
  - Mean-Variance Optimization (MVO)
  - Most Diversified Portfolio (MDP)
  - Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO-lite)
* Implement a working OR-Tools MathOpt + OSQP backend.
* Deliver high-quality documentation and example notebooks.
* Validate reproducibility through deterministic smoke tests.

**Medium-Term Goals (v0.3–v0.5)**

* Introduce advanced constraints:
  - Box and group limits
  - Tracking error and benchmark-relative optimization
* Add richer visualizations and analytics for portfolio composition and risk.
* Extend solver support (e.g., CVXPY, Gurobi adapters).
* Improve test coverage and cross-platform CI builds.

**Long-Term Vision (v1.0+)**

* Establish QPFolio as a **reference implementation** for educational and
  research use in quantitative finance.
* Support distributed optimization and multi-objective extensions.
* Enable robust, interpretable optimization under uncertainty
  using scalable convex and conic methods.

Guiding Motto
-------------

> *Readable code. Reliable math. Reproducible results.*

This motto summarizes QPFolio’s ethos — clarity, integrity, and precision
in both mathematics and software.
