Contributing
============

Thank you for your interest in **QPFolio**!

At this stage, QPFolio is in **early development (v0.1.x)** and not yet open for public contributions.
This page explains the current status, how to provide feedback, and what to expect once contributions open.

----

Current Status
--------------

QPFolio is under active internal development.
During this phase, external code contributions are not being accepted so that the core mathematical
and architectural design can stabilize.

If you would like to follow progress:

* ⭐ Star the project on GitHub to receive updates.
* Review the :doc:`changelog` for new features and milestones.
* Submit feedback or bug reports through GitHub Issues:
  https://github.com/hrolfrc/qpfolio/issues

----

Future Contribution Policy
--------------------------

Once the public contribution phase begins (post-`v1.0.0`), the following guidelines will apply:

1. **Code Style:**
   All code will follow PEP 8 standards and use type hints compatible with ``mypy``.

2. **Testing:**
   New features must include ``pytest`` unit tests and maintain ≥ 90% coverage.

3. **Documentation:**
   Public functions and classes must include docstrings and mathematical context.

4. **Branching Model:**
   Use short, descriptive feature branches and submit pull requests for review.

5. **Commit Messages:**
   Write clear, imperative commit messages (e.g., “Add MDP frontier solver”).

6. **Review and Approval:**
   Every PR will be reviewed by a maintainer before merging into the main branch.

Communication
-------------

Please do not submit unsolicited pull requests at this time.
For questions, feedback, or ideas, open a GitHub issue or use the contact email listed in ``pyproject.toml``.

Acknowledgment
--------------

We appreciate your patience and enthusiasm.
Community contributions will be welcomed once QPFolio’s foundation is stable, reproducible, and well-documented.
