# Security Policy

## Project Status
QPFolio is currently in **early development (v0.1.x pre-release)**.  
At this stage, the software is intended primarily for **research and testing**, not for use in production or financial systems.

Because the project is still evolving:
- No formal security audit has been conducted.
- Security hardening and dependency review are planned for later versions.
- The maintainers are not currently accepting vulnerability reports or running a bug bounty program.

---

## Reporting Security Issues
If you believe you have found a potential security vulnerability, please **do not open a public issue**.  
Instead, you may contact the maintainer privately using the email address listed in the project’s `pyproject.toml` or repository profile.

Responsible disclosure is appreciated. Reports will be acknowledged and reviewed when the security policy becomes active for external use.

---

## Future Policy (Post-Release)
When the project reaches its first stable release (`v1.0.0`), the following will apply:
1. Verified vulnerabilities will be addressed with priority and tracked in the changelog.
2. Critical fixes will result in a new patch release (e.g., `1.0.1`).
3. Security dependencies will be scanned regularly using GitHub’s security features and Dependabot.

## Disclaimer
This software is provided **as-is**, without any warranty or guarantee of security, reliability, or suitability for live financial use.  
Users are advised to evaluate and sandbox the software before applying it to production workflows.

**Summary:**  
> QPFolio is currently a prototype for research and educational use.  
> Security features and formal reporting procedures will be introduced once the project reaches a stable release.
