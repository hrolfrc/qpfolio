# Code of Conduct

## Overview
QPFolio is currently in **early development** and is maintained by a small internal team.  
While the project is not yet open for active external contributions, we value professionalism, respect, and transparency in all forms of communication surrounding the project.

This Code of Conduct outlines the standards of behavior expected now and in the future, once the project becomes community-facing.

---

## Our Pledge
We pledge to create and maintain a welcoming and respectful environment for anyone interested in QPFolio — whether as a user, reviewer, or future contributor.

We aim to foster an atmosphere where ideas are discussed constructively and technical collaboration is conducted with integrity.

---

## Our Standards
Examples of positive behavior include:
- Using inclusive and respectful language.
- Offering constructive feedback.
- Accepting differing viewpoints with professionalism.
- Giving credit where it is due.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- Personal attacks, harassment, or discriminatory remarks.
- Publishing others’ private information without consent.
- Disruptive or intentionally misleading communication.

---

## Current Scope
Since QPFolio is **not yet open for active public contribution**, this Code of Conduct primarily applies to:
- Issue discussions.
- Documentation feedback.
- Any direct communication with project maintainers.

When the project matures and external collaboration opens, a community-specific governance model and enforcement process will be introduced.

---

## Enforcement
For now, all communications related to this project are moderated privately by the maintainer.  
If you have a concern, you may contact the maintainer via the email address listed in the project metadata (`pyproject.toml` or repository profile).

---

## Future Policy
Upon reaching a stable public release (`v1.0.0`), QPFolio intends to adopt a formal governance model consistent with the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/), including:
- Clear reporting mechanisms.
- Defined maintainer responsibilities.
- Public transparency on enforcement outcomes.

---

## Acknowledgment
This document draws inspiration from the Contributor Covenant v2.1 while tailoring its scope for a pre-release, research-oriented software project.

---

**Summary:**  
> QPFolio values respectful, thoughtful interaction.  
> The community will open in time — and when it does, it will be grounded in professionalism and mutual respect.
